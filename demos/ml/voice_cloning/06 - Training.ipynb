    "# Training\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Training, I have created a container that effectively contains the code from notebooks I've found online:\n",
    "\n",
    "* YourTTS: \n",
    "* VITS for one speaker: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wAuG-TcZeAUYhff0f6ZiG-so9KT-sBIE?usp=sharing#scrollTo=psssJnAtRp4-\n",
    "* For VITS multispeaker I merged two aforementioned notebooks myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have also added some background operations:\n",
    "* CoquiTTS saves checkpoints (last 4 states of the models) and \"best\" models according to its metrics. So sometimes there are hours of training that do not produce best models and the checkpoints are deleted. So I added stashing of these intermediate states.\n",
    "* Inference from best- and stahed models, so we could hear how these models sound.\n",
    "* Drawing a plot from the training logs.\n",

    "## Why Docker container?\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing with collab notebooks, containers have the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Notebooks require step-by-step execution, which is not what I want: I want a process I can start from Python or command line and forget about it until it's done.\n",
    "* You can run notebooks at any machine, you only need SSH and Docker for this. Collab notebook you can only run, well, on collab. I believe Docker solution helps avoiding vendor lock.\n",
    "* It's easier to spread: if I need to deliver docker to a remote machine, I just need docker push and pull operations, no interation with server's GUI is required.\n",
    "* I don't trust very much the code written in notebooks: for instance, it's impossible to test it properly. Some of the background operations I've written have unit tests which wouldn't be possible with notebooks.\n",
    "* In general, I recommend using notebooks for what they were designed for - for experiments. I don't want experiments in this area, I want to a ready code that works.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the local machine, there was also an option to run this program under WSL (running it without VM wasn't an option because of espeak problems under Windows). **Avoid this option**. Despite WSL and docker actually use the same Windows subsystem, WSL works far worse and far less predictable. There were numerous problems with it:\n",
    "* First time I run it, it failed after 5 hours.\n",
    "* I \"fixed\" it with `kaia.infra.rebooter` that monitors the log file and restarts the system because of the inactivity. Effectively, it restarted every 10 minutes. This has proven to be bad for the training process itself: despite I continued training with CoquiTTS means, I had the impression it's kinda reset.\n",
    "* After several days of experiments, I've found out that actually running training _in a different console than the rebooter's console_ solves the problem. How exactly sharing console prevents WSL from working properly, I don't know.\n",
    "* After packaging the solution in Docker container, I've never had any problems with this process again.\n",
