 "At least the house and field had not been burned, and there were no corpses about.",
 "Suddenly Masema's eyes bulged, and for the first time, anger flamed in his scent.",
 "Still, each man has his song, as my old master used to say when he was teaching me to play.",
 "The darkness hid his face, but Rand was sure his ears were twitching vigorously.",
 "All Tyrion could see was something massive rising from the river, humped and ominous.",
 "Slowly he staggered along the edge of the thicket, striking like a cutpurse time and again.",
 "When he comes, he will come with far more power than he commanded on the Green Fork.",
 "Putting Ajimbura's cup to his lips, Karede was aware of the other man watching him drink.",
 "When she held the bracelet toward Leane, the Domani woman lifted her wrist eagerly.",
 "The sky was purpling, and the setting sun painted clouds to the west in shades of red.",
 "She'd asked those who'd been there, but nobody had seen him since his conversation with Rand.",
 "He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location.",
 "And Slayer faded, him and his cry together, growing misty, transparent, vanishing.",
 "Mat muttered, stepping out into the hallway as Thom climbed to his feet, Talmanes following.",
 "The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face.",

 "Nynaeve drew in a sharp breath, then went to her knees and pushed Elayne gently aside.",
 "As she leaned back against the wall, thoughts fading, she was overcome with sorrow.",
 "It would not have been the first time Tinkers had come onto important information.",
 "As he lifted his eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out of the sky.",

 "She'll feel it, he thought, ashamed, but if she did, she gave no sign, only clung to him the harder.",
 "The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where their skills lay.",
 "Snow had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still and quiet.",
 "He pretended to rub his forearms, checking the knives up his coatsleeves for reassurance.",
 "Even with the threat they leaped at it, probably more for less work than for the extra silver.",
 "The severed arm was wriggling out of its torn sleeve, a pale snake with a black five-fingered head.",
 "The moon was up, the last thin sliver before the new moon, its faint light defeated by the night.",
 "Septa Mordane would be mortified, and Sansa would never speak to her again from the shame.",
 "Another woman appeared on Thom's other side, lifting her apron off over her head.",
 "That concerned her more than her clothes, though concern was not nearly a strong enough word.",
 "He always looked pained when he tried to think, like it hurt him something fierce.",
 "And that one looked like Hake, though it was hard to know for certain with half his head missing.",
 "She paused to sip at her wine, but when she lowered the goblet, she went on in a different vein.",
 "Juilin could not, but he snatched off his ridiculous red hat and did what he could.",
 "Not that she had learned very much-well, nothing, really-but she could think on them.",
 "His belly was rumbling, a sure sign that the morning was creeping past, and still no sign of food.",
 "The rushes scattered across the cold stone floor did not show any particular disturbance.",
 "Still, it was not the kind of thing he would have considered before Lews Therin.",
 "With a groan like a limb breaking under too great a weight, the Green Man crashed to the ground.",
 "Benfrey, see your sister back to her chambers, she has a wedding to prepare for.",
 "The day was no cooler here than in the city a few miles away, the sun no less blistering.",
 "He twisted around to sit up on the side of the bed with the blankets pulled across his legs.",
 "And she told the tale again, hardly hearing the words as they spilled out of her.",
 "Even a woman who was not Aes Sedai could usually make a man decide the way she wanted.",
 "They were watching him, Dobraine very nearly hiding uncertainty, Idrien making no effort to.",
 "He was not really why she had come, though, only an excuse, and she would not turn back now.",
 "She rode here to get away from the Aiel, yet they could be encountered in the forest, too.",
 "He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know.",
 "This Tormund Thunderfist is likely re-forming them even now, and planning some new assault.",
 "Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked.",
 "His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger.",
 "Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back.",
 "She sifted through the different plans she'd devised, selecting the most likely to succeed.",
 "Give me one hair of suspicion, and I will strap you till you cannot stand, with my own hands.",
 "The motive is unclear, yet it seems very unlikely that he chose his victims by chance.",
 "But as he set the crowbar under the edge of the frame, the door creaked as someone tried to open it.",
 "Your false father is a great lord, and I am just some twisted little monkey man.",
 "It was all he could do not to stretch out a hand to caress the tension between them.",
 "I should think that, with a little effort, we might be able to grow you a sense of humor.",
 "That was when the shouting started, amid the explosions back in the city, and the screaming.",
 "He kept his coin pouch in sight, though, laying it on the floor in front of him.",
 "The darkness behind Ba'alzamon roiled, and furnaces roared as Ba'alzamon laughed.",
 "Not petulant, just absolutely certain that whatever she wanted was right and proper and must be.",
 "She had started it all, stealing his coats and giving him a lord's clothes instead.",
 "Thom looked confused, but Talmanes' lips turned ever so slightly up at the side.",
 "There was still a throne to be won, and every lord and lady who could muster fighting men wanted it.",
 "Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry's wand.",
 "Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon's footsteps walking heavily down the stairs.",
 "Her face might have been carved from marble, and her voice was that hard and cold.",
 "When he turned to find the next victim for his axe, he spied the other captain across the deck.",
 "Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some glasses.",
 "And Quent, Seven save him, he looked like he was going to shit his smallclothes.",
 "Ser Barristan began the long descent alone, his white cloak rippling behind him as he started down.",
 "Both Harry's and Ron's were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee.",
 "Three hundred paces short of the wagons, Rhuarc signaled a halt, and he and Heirn went on alone.",
 "In truth, those thoughts still flashed into her head when least expected, lists or no lists.",
 "Tire a woman, and she could sleep for a few hours and be back up to fight again.",
 "His own masters were not the most trusting of people, and not always the most trustworthy.",
 "Even here inside, he wore his cloak, all covered with fluttering patches in a hundred colors.",
 "If you do shit gold, Father, find a privy and get busy, he wanted to say, but he knew better.",
 "Green boys screaming for their mothers, he'd thought, but he killed them all the same.",
 "Her head would have lolled except for Verin's grip, and her eyelids were half-closed.",
 "Knives and forks stilled, suspended in mid-air, and all eyes turned to the Warder.",
 "She pointed to a stall where a wizened little woman was grilling meat and onions on a hot firestone.",
 "Some of the men shared a skin of Galbart Glover's apple wine, passing it from hand to hand.",
 "Tylin must be scaring him more than he thought, if he was shriveling up this way.",
 "Perrin opened his mouth to tell the man not to call him that, but he closed it again with a sigh.",
 "He seemed as affronted as a Two Rivers girl would have been in the same circumstance.",
 "Patches of fog glowed red for an instant as if great fires had suddenly flared beneath, then died.",
 "The night before meeting the Wise Ones, as if to hone their skills one last time before a contest.",
 "Siuan shot her a look that almost made her rein her horse back, all icy eyes and hard chin.",
 "Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was-",
 "Trying to get her to do anything she did not want to was like hitting a sack of feathers.",
 "As it happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room.",
 "The night the driftwood crown was placed on Euron's head, she and her crew had melted away.",
 "But you could see as much in Cairhien, if not in quite the same numbers or quite as much variety.",
 "A hundred brazen-throated trumpets shiver the air, and drums rattle like thunder.",
 "Ta'veren had always been her explanation for most of the disturbing rumors out of Cairhien.",
 "The line of light turned upon itself, opening a view that was not of southern Kandor.",
 "Holly and her knife would be of small use against six men in mail with swords and spears.",
 "Fedwin smiled back happily and tried to take the cup, but Rand held it for him to drink.",
 "He immediately wiped the smile off his face when the two women raised their eyebrows at him.",
 "No one will trouble her, he told himself, and in a fortnight we shall be safely away.",
 "For more reasons than one, it made him think of the last time he had been in Falme.",
 "It was midday when Brienne heard chanting drifting through the bare brown trees.",
 "There, a woman in white-a woman with stringy blond hair who was far too old to be a novice.",
 "My brother loved the fight for its own sake, but I only play such games as I can win.",
 "They could she her forehead reddening over the top of her book, which was upside down.",
 "Zomaran in snowy white were there instantly with wine, yet Moridin received his first.",

 "The lion woke up and coughed, a deep sound guaranteed to raise the hair on anyone's head.",
 "Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them.",
 "A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair.",
 "That was the tale they had put about, two women in an isolated house, killed for their jewelry.",
 "Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat.",
 "Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort's complete lack of fear.",
 "They could open a portal like this into the Empress's own chambers, may she live forever.",
 "I saw a slender girl with silvery hair wrapped in a tokar, he might have told them.",
 "Somehow, the people realized that, and it was very hard for Rand to look at them.",
 "The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling.",
 "Perrin felt a moment of weakness, the wound across his chest throbbing as he and Slayer tumbled.",
 "You ask many more questions, and I'll see what a few days scrubbing pots will do for you.",
 "But the rest of the village knew of it, and apparently considered strangers fair gleanings.",
 "The air beyond the walls still looked too dim, as though a shading cloud hung over the town.",
 "Maester Luwin's voice cracked through the clangor of the yard as loud as a thunderclap.",
 "A track, Rand decided as they set out, would be something natural in that world.",
 "Of everything he had considered going amiss tonight, Tylin returning early had never been in it.",
 "If they decided to strike for Tear, even giving Darlin gateways back might not be enough to help.",
 "A few trees spotted the hillsides, but most of the land had been cleared and planted.",
 "When she told Siuan as much, and her reasoning, the taller woman grunted sourly.",
 "Yesterday's gleanings were waiting on the table, an untidy stack as tall as the first had been.",
 "She had such a wondering look that Elayne was not sure whether or not that was a joke.",
 "He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other's faces.",
 "Marie glanced at her curiously, between studying every servant who entered the hallway.",
 "She obeyed, choosing one of the four chairs suddenly arranged near the center of the platform.",
 "Its name came from more than the gray marking on its back that resembled a human skull.",
 "He shifted sullen, angry eyes, and for the first time appeared to see the newcomers.",
 "The servants were gone, and the Trollocs as well, though he had not seen them go.",
 "For an instant she could only stare at the other woman, eyes going wider and wider.",
 "Either way, she had very neatly cut Moiraine out of the hunt for the next week or more.",
 "She could not help toting up in her head what it would cost to feed fifteen men.",
 "When they looked at whichever was speaking, the other could observe them unnoticed.",
 "Raen accompanied them as far as the edge of the trees, a pair of the dogs cavorting by his side.",
 "She often found herself listing such advantages, perhaps trying to convince herself they were real.",
 "At the end of the day's march, Tyrion had sent Bronn back to find him a likely whore.",
 "Staggering back until he thumped into the table, he shouted, trying to drown the sound in his ears.",
 "A gai'shain woman brought in a gilded lamp, already lit, and set it beside the tray.",
 "No one but Birgitte was close enough to overhear, but she did not want to take foolish chances.",
 "Rafela's round face, normally mild and pleasant, was quite stern, and her usually sweet voice flat.",
 "In creating his vision of a world without the Dark One, he had created something horrible.",
 "There had been a note of something in her voice, as if she knew more than he did.",
 "Replace them with a memory of talking to a merchant family and securing their alliance.",
 "The world was rarely changed by men who were unwilling to try being at least one of the three.",
 "That was when the monkeys left the ship, screeching as they leapt into the water.",
 "His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble.",
 "Leilwin, if she insisted, though he was still certain she would regain her senses eventually.",
 "They were tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur, every one a lord or lady to her eyes.",
 "The best of people could turn muleheaded if they realized you wanted them to behave a certain way.",
 "In any case, the others were already crowding through the gates, though not in any neat array, now.",
 "Ghostly strings entwined around his heart, pulling him, calling him to the spire mountain.",
 "The sun climbed high, a red ball that could not give so much warmth despite the cloudless sky.",
 "Those horrible eyes had fixed on Moghedien, not her, but she was going to die too.",
 "The custom of not talking about age soon enough became the habit of not thinking about it, either.",
 "It's strange, but the longer he has been locked up, the easier in himself he has become.",
 "If she was more than casual about being naked in front of him, Aiel customs were different.",
 "It would take me days to teach all the combinations to you, and you do not need to know them.",
 "That should bring the Shaido in right enough, especially if Couladin was leading.",
 "Men were as different from women in the Power as they were in flesh, maybe more so.",
 "The wind whipped their Warder cloaks about, leaving their hands free for swords if need be.",
 "He sniffed at the air, turning about, trying to catch the scent of Slayer's location.",

 "Min appeared to be reading still, but each hand rested near the opposite cuff of her coatsleeves.",
 "From his shoulders trailed a cloak of Lannister crimson patterned with golden hands.",
 "If not, perhaps Clegane will let you live after he and his pack are done raping you.",
 "Fain's eyes went to the painting of the two men, and as he gazed at it, his back straightened.",
 "Bela charged across the trampled ground, hoofbeats accompanying thunder from above.",
 "Sammael had always wanted to be taller, and resented it that the Power could not make him so.",
 "They hurried as best they could in the hope of beating it, but he did not think they would.",
 "If this whole Doomseer title did not work out for her, perhaps she could find work as a chandelier.",
 "She pressed her lips together and hardened her heart and rode on toward the gate.",
 "People said Aiel showed no emotion, but it was just that they were more reserved than most.",
 "Her footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead of her as Arya plunged deeper into the darkness.",
 "She bought drinks, and she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby.",
 "You didn't get mad at the weasel who was sneaking into your yard and eating your hens.",
 "She scooted to the corner and peered cautiously around the edge of the building.",
 "Many a voyager has been lost here, poleboats and pirates and great river galleys too.",
 "They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway.",
 "Looking closely, he was able to make out the form of a shadowed man with a crooked nose.",
 "Birgitte's arrow punched through the clenched fist embossed on his leather breastplate.",
 "They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase.",
 "They protruded like budding eyes, giving the throne an ornate richness that Rand disliked.",
 "Perhaps the Light cloaked the tower watch's eyes and allowed him to reach the walls.",
 "These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of Snatchers.",
 "At the same time, he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff.",
 "Moiraine folded the letter, returning it to her belt pouch with a touch of acerbity in her manner.",
 "He couldn't be sure she was in Arad Doman, though it felt right to him, from what he knew of her.",
 "Amador did not hold the Atha'an Miere in good favor, and the attitude was returned with interest.",
 "Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond.",
 "As soon as her feet were on the ground outside, she was suddenly her normal size again.",
 "After all he'd learned training with the Band, he was certain nobody would push him around.",
 "He had been strange since he was a boy, it was said, hardly Aiel at all, though no one knew why.",
 "Scanning the camp, she noted two gai'shain in hooded white robes hurrying to the front of the line.",
 "Hulking Lamgwin rode watching the forest, Breane at his side watching him as much as anything else.",
 "She could vaguely remember what it had been like, taking those first few steps toward the Shadow.",
 "All that day she watched, and well into the night, until her legs ached from the standing.",
 "Her laughter faded, and the jokes came further apart, each one more strained than the last.",
 "A wolfhound mourning his dead mistress did not come to a new mistress willingly.",
 "Khaleesi, the Seven Kingdoms are not going to fall into your hands like so many ripe peaches.",
 "Early in their association, Mat had assumed him to be stern, unable to have fun.",
 "Moiraine rode closer to Lan and spoke softly, but Perrin managed to catch her words.",
 "Light help me, Verin, how I loved you for those sweetcakes, and for your bosom to weep on.",
 "Meanwhile, at the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge.",
 "Strangely, the angreal that fitted Nynaeve so well, fit on her longer hand just as easily.",
 "Two hundred feet the tower rose, and forty thick, gleaming like burnished steel.",
 "You may not be one of the sisters, but you carry your nose high enough for one, so there it is.",
 "In other words, it was precisely the sort of place where nobody would expect to find her.",
 "My father's estates do produce lumber and fine woods, and ice peppers, and furs, and more besides.",
 "Everything seemed to shift sideways as the darkness thickened in midnight lumps.",
 "But Egwene persevered, with her eyes glistening and bright spots of color in her cheeks.",
 "He might have been Robert's ghost as he stood there, young and dark and handsome.",
 "A vase of freshly cut dara lilies and calima blossoms sat there, right where it should.",
 "When they entered the grove, Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn.",
 "Grigg the Goat led them past the few inhabited villages that remained in these lands.",
 "A feeble barrier, yet she could ignore him by looking at the sheet of paper under Aybara's finger.",
 "Give a man sympathy at the wrong moment, and you never regained the ground lost.",
 "A stooped shape in a leather jerkin, head down and arms loaded with bundles, shambled at her heels.",
 "Elsewhere in the crowd, Elayne spotted Birgitte, wisely keeping away from her this morning.",
 "He looked at Perrin, making a globe of light for them to see by as they walked in the night.",
 "After that men called him Badbrother, though in truth they'd been no kin of his.",
 "Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light.",
 "She was holding a sleeping Dailin so Chiad could slip a shirt of brown linen onto her.",
 "It would not have mattered if she had not seen the aura since her first viewing of it in Tar Valon.",
 "The town was afire, black plumes of smoke roiling and tumbling as they rose into a hard blue sky.",
 "Ituralde briefly heard Ankaer's voice taking command, screaming at the men to get back into line.",
 "And if a woman were to wish for a legacy, she could not dream of greater than one such as you.",
 "Whitecloak or not, every inch she could shift him from being her jailer was a victory.",
 "Humming to herself, eyes lidded, Aviendha looked half asleep as she watched him search.",
 "She paused for an instant in drawing on her red gloves and began tapping her foot.",
 "He was thirteen today, and tall for his age, with the green eyes and golden hair of the Lannisters.",
 "Amalisa straightened in slow, stiff jerks, as if she had been bound hand and foot for hours.",
 "His black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw.",
 "Still, there were plenty of glum faces and sour mutters as hasty camps began going up.",
 "It sounded stupid, high and hollow and quavering, a little boy's howl, not a wolf's.",
 "Cadsuane watched the Forsaken go, carried on weaves of Air, then shook her head.",
 "There was just room for a desk, but it would so crowd the space that she'd barely be able to move.",
 "The Blight flowed past, weeds and grasses splashing rotten under galloping hooves.",
 "Some of them spoke to him, but he could not understand, though the words sounded as if he should.",
 "Mat kept looking out, remembering maps, but overlaying them with the real combat.",
 "Amys's face was not easy to make out in the darkness, but Egwene did not see any softening.",
 "The others were as choice a lot of mercenaries as ever graced a dungeon, each uglier than the last.",
 "He did not look at Gelb as he coiled a line on deck, working it in with his bare toes.",
 "She blushed when she realized that some were performing more than acrobatic tricks.",
 "When Margaery echoed the words he pulled her close and kissed her long and deep.",
 "Despite Egwene's capture, talks continued under the pavilion at the foot of the bridge in Darein.",
 "At the sound, Cadsuane leaped to her feet, embracing saidar, quite nearly rushing into the room.",
 "You will have your chance to rage at me-to do whatever you like-when I have finished.",
 "He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin.",
 "I did not remember it until I tried puzzling out where Rand could have vanished to.",
 "Juilin was grumbling to himself as he caught water in the tiny stream to refill the water barrels.",
 "Ser Jorah wiped the grease off his mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close over the table.",
 "They dismounted at the stables sitting catty-corner, and Greenbeard bellowed for grooms.",
 "He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself.",
 "Below, a man stumbled out from behind a mound of rubble, swinging expertly with his sword.",
 "Those had been cleansed and scoured by the abrasive hands of scholars looking for conciseness.",
 "Perhaps she knew how he could avoid losing himself, what was human in him, to the wolves.",
 "In the hallway, the Cairhienin nobles were returning noisily from the demonstration of the dragons.",
 "The city docks were reserved for the grain barges and the pleasure craft of the lords and ladies.",
 "She laughed softly and began playing with a button on his coat, peering at it intently.",
 "If Nynaeve knew he was on his way, there would be little room in her head for anything else.",
 "The way she had touched his arm and smiled for him had tied Tyrion's guts into knots.",
 "He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go.",
 "So long as you refrain from entering the dream for a while longer, they should stay away.",
 "He almost slipped his skin and reached out for his wolf, but Summer might be miles away.",
 "She studied her weave, melded together so snugly that only a few threads remained distinct.",
 "He thought he heard Guardsmen's rattles, but it might have been the blood pounding in his ears.",
 "No word on Rand's whereabouts, either, said a cringing report filled with near panic.",
 "The woman wore a dress colored like the sky on a clear day, set with trim like clouds.",
 "He smelled of ash, but the morning sun was in his hair, giving it a golden glow.",
 "The Second Sons kept their company armor in six big wayns drawn up near the center of their camp.",
 "Thinking of the brand had made it itch, so he had to scratch himself before he closed his eyes.",
 "Even if the Asha'man did sometimes stare off into nothing, muttering to themselves.",
 "The men who are chosen at Rhuidean, those who survive, return marked on the left arm.",
 "Surprisingly, neither Romanda nor Lelaine had opened her mouth since the beginning.",
 "Bashere lowered the glass to study the camp, then pressed it back to his eye for a closer look.",
 "No one traveled beyond the village by night, not these days, certainly not alone.",
 "With that, she could gain all the power she wished, much more than any Amyrlin had ever wielded.",
 "Its color-shifting nature made them nearly invisible, if they were careful not to move.",
 "The ground exploded, rocks flying upward as the blast threw her forward into the air.",
 "Suddenly Nynaeve realized that there had not been a single obscene word in that.",
 "Mat watched the girl's face for a time to be certain he would recognize her again.",
 "The sailor burst out laughing, and Mat raised the flute as if to throw it at him.",
 "A glance back down the alley showed dust and rubble piled at least a story high.",
 "Even though Merise was controlling the flows, the vileness of saidin turned Elza's stomach.",
 "Egeanin had already placed her wrists together in the small of her back, compliant if not meek.",
 "With a bellowing scream, he clung to this knowledge as the people around him held to their flotsam.",
 "Vanin could steal a horse out from under a nobleman without the nobleman knowing it for two days.",
 "She stood, wishing she could have a little longer to make matters clear to Taim.",
 "Wrapped in the Void, Rand could hear his heartbeat, smell the sweat of troubled dreams.",
 "Frowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand.",
 "Egwene glanced back often, until trees and hills hid Fal Dara's walls and towers.",
 "Live, he told himself harshly, when the mush was like to gag him, live for Cersei, live for Tyrion.",
 "It was true, though she had never before rated the Aes Sedai's ability so closely.",
 "As she ducked out into the dusk, the two Warders standing guard outside bowed to her.",
 "She should never have let herself get to a point where she'd been forced to drop the soup.",
 "They're far more Shadow than they are either one, Lan thought, lowering his spyglass.",
 "You could never be sure until you started slicing away the excess, but the stave looked perfect.",
 "As a result, she was forced to deal out correction much more often that she should have had to.",
 "The Warders were the only ones at the tables, and as a rule, Warders drank little and seldom.",
 "She peered around the kitchen again, frowning as though puzzled to find herself there, and left.",
 "There was so much Rand wanted to say, but he could not manage to get it all into words.",
 "Most Aiel disdained maps, but Sevanna had taken to them along with other wetland customs.",
 "Suddenly, pieces clicked in Egwene's mind like a blacksmith's puzzle coming undone.",
 "It was all another effort to put him in his place, whatever she thought that was.",
 "I settled down, learning the room and preparing to open a Gateway in the morning.",
 "I have crawled through the depths of sorrow and have risen up to accept my glory.",
 "Not with the Amyrlin waiting, not with what she had to tell the Amyrlin waiting.",
 "In many ways she was not so tough, he had heard, as the woman who had worn the stole before her.",
 "He could disregard the thunderstorm outside, but Min, snuggling under his arm, was another matter.",
 "For a moment he stared down at her with those dark, beautiful eyes, then abruptly laughed.",
 "We can destroy all of them, even Asmodean, once he has taught you all you need to know.",
 "I have a little task for you, and you'll need your strength back if you are to serve me.",
 "By everything she had been taught, she should ask a penance for what she had told him already.",
 "The song of saidin caressed him with seduction, pulled him with a thousand silken strings.",
 "The maneuvers not only kept their skills sharp, but exercised the horses as well.",
 "Mat reluctantly struck, silencing him before he could howl and bring more people against them.",
 "Meera Reed was sixteen, a woman grown, but she stood no higher than her brother.",
 "It began to slick his hair, cap or no, and seep through his coat as soon as he stepped outside.",
 "He made himself keep his eyes strictly on her face, but even so his cheeks felt hot.",
 "Pips and the other horses were well trained, and the four of them charged straight down the street.",
 "He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room.",
 "A burst of red light from nearby atop the Heights launched toward the smoke of the dragons.",
 "Bonding would last a lifetime, of course, yet it was better than any sort of alliance.",
 "Leane gripped the hilt of her belt knife and peered around as if expecting an attack.",
 "Uno and the rest of the soldiers shifted in their saddles and loosened swords in their scabbards.",
 "Alviarin had heard the words coming out of Elaida's mouth when the Foretelling took her.",
 "Rand certainly was more in control of himself now, but he was by no means emotionless.",
 "She blinked at the silver bow in her hand, and it vanished along with the quiver.",
 "Several Sharans came forward with swords, but Demandred raised a gauntleted hand to warn them off.",
 "Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off.",
 "The notion sent goose bumps marching across his skin, but he had known it would be done.",
 "Merrett loosened his sword in its scabbard and looked about warily, but saw no outlaws.",
 "Rand glanced around the room as the man departed, backing away still half-bowed.",
 "Instead the big knight carried him, hoisting him by the chain between his wrists.",
 "The camp was quiet, with evening meals cooking over small fires beside the wagons.",
 "I guess I could ask him, Rand thought idly as he made a notation to himself on a piece of paper.",
 "She hiccoughed loudly, patted her hair and pulled herself up on Harry's helping arm.",
