    "In order for algorithms to be stable and not affected by other parts of the application, the algorithms should run in a different thread or even application. They should be as isolated from the rest of the Smart home, especially from its intelligent and communication components, as much as possible. But in this case, how do we monitor and control them?\n",

    "* `IStorage` that saves all the data from spaces as unstructured data. We don't create columns for each of the space fields: first, we don't really need it; second, that would bring all sorts of the migration problems when changing these fields. Instead, we `jsonpickle` the states' current values. `jsonpickle` is used instead of `pickle` to allow reading the logs even in the absence of the source code. \n",
    "* `IMessenger` is a messaging queue: sender sends a message with various tags, and receiver can get the messages of the specified tags in a time-sorted order, and close them with replies.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on this, there are two control systems created. The first is with `gradio` that shows the data from the space as an interactive plot, and allows controlling the algorithm with wegbui elements. The second is with `eaglesong` that allows some of the controlling via `Telegram`.\n",
